    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An easy recipe for protein pancakes, made with six simple ingredients, including
        protein powder and greek yogurt.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li>sweetener</li>
        <li>greek yogurt</li>
        <li>protein powder</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by whisking together the eggs, vanilla, stevia, and Greek yogurt.</li>
        <li>
            Now, whisk in the protein powder. Whisk patiently and thoroughly until completely
             smooth and free of lumps, then whisk in the baking powder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a nonstick double-burner griddle over medium heat (not higher). Spray it with oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a 1.5-tablespoon cookie scoop, pour six to eight mounds of the batter into the
            griddle (or use a large 14-inch nonstick skillet and cook three or four pancakes at a time).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the pancakes over medium heat until they bubble on top, 1 minute or even less. Flip and
            cook them for just a few more seconds, then remove them to a plate, add more fat to the
            skillet if needed, and cook the remaining pancakes.
        </li>
    </ol>

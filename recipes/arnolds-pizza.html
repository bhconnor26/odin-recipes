    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fat free greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 chicken sausage</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fat free cheddar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fat free feta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>sliced onion, spinach, brocolli, mushrooms, or veggies of choice</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475 with a sheet pan. Make sure the rack is centered.</li>
        <li>
            Mix flour, yeast, and greek yogurt together and stir until you get a shaggy dough.
            Work with your hands until you get a dough ball and there are no more bits of dry flour.
            I knead in the bowl for about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape dough into a ball and place on an oil sprayed square of parchment paper. Using another
            piece of oiled parchment paper on top, flatten and roll out using a rolling pin or bottle
            until it is about 1/4" thick. Remove top parchment paper. Total pizza should be 8" in diameter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add toppings, transfer pizza to preheated sheet pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have a pizza paddle or another sheet pan, use that to transfer pizza with paper to preheated
            pan. If not ou can remove the pre-heated sheet pan, transfer the pizza onto it, and then put it back
            in the oven. If using another sheet pan, just use it upside down to transfer so the pizza can slide right off!
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn oven down to 450Â° and bake for 8 minutes. The top will be browning and bubbly.
        </li>
    </ol>
